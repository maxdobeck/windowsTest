# Summary:
After moving from a Linux environment to an Enterprise Windows environment I've found that I need to be more flexible in my software and tool usage.  In that spirit I've been following the guide that [Git has put out] (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository).  The following is a step-by-step guide in case I ever need a reference for setting up a Windows workstation.

## Installation
After considering running Git through a Sublime package I found that setting up the basic command line interface to be the easiest path to version control nirvana.  With one centralized place for Git access I could use any IDE or text editor for any set of files and then return to the command line to push it to the repository.

I downloaded the Git for Windows to essentially be a bash terminal command line interface.  Currently I'm running [version 2.8.1](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).  I chose most of the defaults for the installation which will give you the Shell integration and the GUI.  Both seem like they have their places and could be easier to use in certain situations.  For instance, you can right click from any windows explorer session and launch the GUI or the bash-like command line interface.

## Git Setup
During installation you may have created a shortcut to the git bash shell or you may have opted to use the native Windows command prompt.  I will be using the Git provided bash-like shell.  You can launch it by either searching for "Git Bash" or launching the desktop icon you created.
